# Installation and Setup

## Installation from Pip

In order to use our APIs, you can simply install `trustwise` pip package.

```{note}
The pip package name has not been finalized yet. If something other than `trustwise` is chosen, these docs will be updated accordingly.
```

```
pip install trustwise
```

## Installation from source

```{note}
This is a placeholder section. It has not been finalized yet if Trustwise will provide the functionality to install from source. We will update this section accordingly once the decision is taken.
```
